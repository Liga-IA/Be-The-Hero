# Be-The-Hero

Backend and Frontend of the Be The Hero Project of the Omnistack Week

# How to Launch it

## On localhost

- `cd` into the project folder
- `npm i` to install the dependencies
- `npm run migrations` on the backend to create the tables on the DB
- `npm start` on both projects to execute

## On web (Development Mode)

It is basically the same of the localhost, but I recommend you to deploy one gitpod environment for each project and change the api URL on api.js file located at `frontend/src/services/api.js` to the public url to the port 3333 of the gitpod env of the backend
